1. need to give members of org write/admin permissions in settings
2. need a .gitignore for bin and obj folders for merging conflicts
3. git pull origin main --rebase creates a detached head branch (DO NOT WANT) that causes fatal errors with git pull and git push (You are currently not a branch)
4. solution to the above mentioned issue:
    - git checkout main //returns you to the main branch
    - git merge //another command to pull/merge?
    - accept both changes on changed files
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "commit message"
    - git push
    - SUCCESS
-designated lines for members to write their code but line spacing and order of code were not merging as expected
